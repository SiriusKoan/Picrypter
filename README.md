## Description

This telegram bot is devised to help people **encrypt and decrypt confidential photos** with user-specified passwords, through *linear algebra* techniques.



## Bot Introduction

`/start` : Show greeting and the customized keyboard.

`/end` : Clear data.

`/encrypt` : Encrypt the image with the password.

`/dncrypt` : Decrypt the image with the password. 

`Text Message` : Store as the password.

`Image File Message` :  Store as an image file.



## Manual

1.  Type in `/start` to get the customized keyboard.

2. Press the `/image` button and send the **image file**.

   *Note*: Remember to press `Send as File` and **DO NOT** check *compression*.

3. Press the `/password` button and enter the password.

4. Press the `/encrypt` / `decrypt`button and wait for a response.

   + `Warning! Fail to encrypt!`

     This warning arises when you haven not entered the password or send the image file. Please make sure previous steps are finished. 

   + `Wait a moment...`

     Your image is being encrypted or decrypted now! 

     Wait about 5 ~ 10 seconds, the bot will send back the encrypted / decrypted image.

     *Note*: If there is no response for a too long period of time, *Time Out* may have occurred due to some server error or the file size is overwhelming. Please do *step 2 to 4* again or try another smaller image . 
     
     *Note*: Should your image be too large, you can compress it via telegram first (send it to someone with *compression* checked). Yet remember **NOT** to check *compression* while sending your image to the bot!

5. Get the Image File!

6. Type in `/end` to clear your data.



## What We Have Done Behind This Bot

1. Expand user-specified password into a long key by ***a large, random generated matrix (6000 by 100)***.
2. The key is then divided into several vectors, with each vector comprising 10 entries, acting as *columns* for a new matrix ***A***.
3. Each vector of the key will undergo *check of linear independence*, from the beginning: If the current vector is linearly independent with all the preceding vectors, it will be added into ***A***, otherwise discarded.
4. ***A*** has been constructed!
5. Compute ***E = A^T A***, where ***E*** is invertible for ***A*** has *linearly independent* columns!
6. ***E*** is then used to encrypt and decrypt images ! (***E*** depends on user-specified password.)
